# C-calculator
C++ Advanced Calculator is a command-line tool capable of performing basic arithmetic 
operations as well as advanced
mathematical functions such as trigonometry
(sine, cosine, tangent), logarithms, and exponentiation. 
It can be expanded further using libraries like SymEngine for symbolic computations, allowing it to 
handle derivatives and integrals directly within a console environment.
